# NFA-DFA-CONVERTOR
This project implements the conversion of NFA to DFA using Python. It accepts user-defined automata inputs, generates transition tables, identifies final and dead states, and ensures deterministic behavior for efficient computation. The project bridges automata theory with real-world implementation.
